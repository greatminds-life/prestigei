If you’ve taken a few SAT writing tests, you’re probably realizing that it’s not as easy as it’s cracked up to be. At first glance, it seems like a test that doesn’t require much of a strategy, unlike reading or math. A lot of it seems like, well, common sense. So why is it so difficult to get a perfect score? And what is with all the complicated punctuations, anyway? Does the absence of a semicolon really matter?! 

What most people don’t understand is that the writing test assesses your understanding of the conventions of English and composition -- in short, it evaluates your ability to understand and revise academic texts. Those seemingly arbitrary commas and dashes? They all serve specific purposes. 

Here we list five things many students say they wished they knew about the SAT writing test: 


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
