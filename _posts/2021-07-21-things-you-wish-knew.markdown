If you’ve taken a few SAT writing tests, you’re probably realizing that it’s not as easy as it’s cracked up to be. At first glance, it seems like a test that doesn’t require much of a strategy, unlike reading or math. A lot of it seems like, well, common sense. So why is it so difficult to get a perfect score? And what is with all the complicated punctuations, anyway? Does the absence of a semicolon really matter?! 

What most people don’t understand is that the writing test assesses your understanding of the conventions of English and composition -- in short, it evaluates your ability to understand and revise academic texts. Those seemingly arbitrary commas and dashes? They all serve specific purposes.

Here we list five things many students say they wished they knew about the SAT writing test

#### What sounds right isn’t always right
The truth is, a surprising amount of what we say in conversation is grammatically incorrect. Therefore, relying on what we say as the standard for selecting answers on the test isn’t the best way to land that perfect score.

#### A comma makes all the difference
You’ve heard of the unfortunate tale of the boy who wrote Let’s eat Grandma instead of Let’s eat, Grandma. The unassuming comma may seem harmless, but if used incorrectly, it can change an entire sentence. Fortunately, there are a few rules about commas that you need to know to do well on the writing test -- on week 2, we go over all the do’s and don’ts.

#### Just because it’s a writing test doesn’t mean you don’t have to read
The assumption is that reading the passage isn’t as important on the writing test, but this isn’t true. Grammar questions aside, many of the rhetorical questions will require that you understand the relationship between sentences, paragraphs, and ideas. Although you may not be reading for line references (like the reading test), you still need to read!

#### There are a set number of grammar rules on the SAT
The world of grammar is as vast as it is wide, but the great thing is that you only need to know a set number of them for the SAT writing test. Why study more than you need to know? In just 5 weeks, we go over all of the ones that you’ll see on the test!

#### There are correct answers, and then there are more correct answers
Sometimes, more than one answer option might be grammatically correct, but efficiency matters! After all, good writing is also about being succinct. If you can say “I know I can do well on this test,” why say “I am confident with the knowledge that I will be able to successfully demonstrate my ability on this test?”
